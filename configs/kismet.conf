# Do we process the contents of data frames?  If this is enabled, data
# frames will be truncated to the headers only immediately after frame type
# detection.  This will disable IP detection, etc, however it is likely
# safer (and definitely more polite) if monitoring networks you do not own.
hidedata=true

# Do we allow plugins to be used?  This will load plugins from the system
# and user plugin directiories when set to true (See the README for the default
# plugin locations).

# Control which channels we like to spend more time on.  By default, the list
# of channels is pulled from the driver automatically.  By setting preferred channels,
# if they are present in the channel list, they'll be set with a timing delay so that
# more time is spent on them.  Since 1, 6, 11 are the common default channels, it makes
# sense to spend more time monitoring them.
# For finer control, see further down in the config for the channellist= directives.

# Default channel lists
# These channel lists MUST BE PRESENT for Kismet to work properly.  While it is
# possible to change these, it is not recommended.  These are used when the supported
# channel list can not be found for the source; to force using these instead of
# the detected supported channels, override with channellist= in the source defintion
#
# IN GENERAL, if you think you want to modify these, what you REALLY want to do is
# copy them and use channellist= in the packet source.
